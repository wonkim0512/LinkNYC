### Good-Bye Pay Phone, Hello Link! ###
*LinkNYC is a first-of-its-kind communications network that will replace over 7,500 pay phones across the five boroughs with new structures called Links. Each Link provides superfast, free public Wi-Fi, phone calls, device charging and a tablet for access to city services, maps and directions.* - [LinkNYC](https://www.link.nyc/)
